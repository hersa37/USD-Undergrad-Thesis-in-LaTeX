# USD Undergrad Thesis in LaTeX

So far, USD's thesis has been written using Microsoft Word, or something similar. I'm trying to have some fun and try to make a template of it in LaTeX. LaTeX has the advantage of making more scientific/math based writings cleaner with its libraries that allow you to write equations and draw graphs directly on the document instead of importing such things. Displaying code is also easier because you can just link your code and have syntax highlighting enabled, instead of taking screenshots.

There are a lot of downsides to LaTeX. It's not a visual-based text processor, so it's basically like writing code. There are things in Word that have no equivalent in LaTeX. 

Even so, this is an attempt at making a proper template. This repo itself is still not finished. It is a collection of test files and attempts to make the template conform to the format. If you have any ideas or would be willing to help, feel free to send a PR or add tot he issues

## Running Tex
To run it, open [test.tex](test.tex) use TeXStudio and set the build to use LuaLatex.

## TODO
As of now, TODO is integrated into the TeX file. Will add it separately to this readme once I have more time to do so
